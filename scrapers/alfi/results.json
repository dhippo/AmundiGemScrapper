ALFI, responding from the perspective of investment fund managers and fund management companies, provided comments, proposed alignments between regulatory requirements and clarifications, and raised certain concerns to be considered as the views of the Luxembourg investment fund industry, particularly in the segment focused on cross-border distribution within the European Union and globally.\n\nThe main advocacy points in ALFI’s response to the consultation are as follows:\n\nScope of the Guidelines – Investment fund managers (IFMs):\n\nUncertainty remains regarding the inclusion of IFMs in the Guidelines, both at individual entity level and at consolidated level. Clarification is needed on the criteria that define the scope of these Guidelines, in order to avoid diverging interpretations of the position of IFMs and the risk of regulatory arbitrage across the Union. Furthermore, we support joint advocacy with other industry associations in the EU and EFAMA, in favour of a full exclusion of Class 2 investment firms from the scope, as these entities are neither systemically relevant nor part of the banking sector. In our view, IFMs are already subject to robust regulatory frameworks, including the UCITS and AIFMD directives, as well as sector-specific rules that clearly set out requirements for managing outsourcing-related risks. These existing measures already provide a comprehensive approach to operational resilience without the need for additional layers of regulation.\n\nScope of the Guidelines – Third-party service providers (TPSPs):\n\nConcerns are raised regarding the expansion of the definition of TPSPs to cover all non-ICT third-party service providers, including subcontracting and delegation arrangements. In view of the potential overlap with existing regulatory requirements (e.g. AIFMD II and UCITS V) and their governance and oversight obligations, particular care is necessary to avoid diverging oversight requirements. In the same vein, we suggest that TPSPs which are themselves regulated financial entities subject to prudential supervision, as well as financial data providers, should be excluded from the scope. As part of upcoming simplifications to DORA and other regulatory requirements, we advise that TPSPs not supporting critical and important functions (CIFs) should be removed from the Register of Information provided to the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) (both under DORA and the present Guidelines), while remaining in the version of the register maintained at financial entity level.\n\nAlignment with DORA:\n\nALFI supports the initiative of the ESAs to streamline the risk management requirements under DORA and these Guidelines, as applied to ICT and non-ICT third-party service providers. To this end, we suggest further aligning the final Guidelines with DORA, in particular regarding:\n\nthe definition and criteria of critical and important functions (CIFs), based on the definition provided in DORA Regulation (EU) 2022/2554, Recital (70);\n\nthe Register of Information (ROI) format, fields, and submission timeline, to allow firms to maintain a single register of TPSPs across regulatory requirements;\n\npre-contractual requirements and onboarding processes with prospective TPSPs, which should be aligned with those in DORA, and the removal of any additional requirements beyond DORA;\n\nthe provision to maintain all terminated contracts for five years after termination, which should be removed as it is not included in the relevant DORA RTS;\n\nthe consistent integration of any upcoming simplifications in the relevant DORA Level 1 and 2 requirements into these Guidelines.\n\nWe also recommend establishing a formal process for regular reviews to ensure ongoing alignment with DORA amendments and simplifications, in order to maintain regulatory consistency over time.\n\nView the\n\nALFI response.\n\nBACK"

        "content": "Europe’s productive capital gap: ALFI/McGill study reveals lessons from pension reforms abroad\n\n8 October 2025\n\n|\n\nPress Releases\n\nLuxembourg, 8 October 2025\n\nMobilising pension and household savings to scale up risk capital\n\nCountries with capitalised pension systems hold two to three times more risk-bearing assets per worker than pay-as-you-go (PAYG) peers: almost EUR 250,000 in Sweden and Canada, compared to EUR 66,000-EUR 91,000 in Germany and France.\n\nThis gap emerged gradually over 20-30 years of steady pension reforms, rather than abrupt policy shifts.\n\nHigher savings and higher equity exposure reinforce each other: Sweden allocates 75% of pension assets to risky capital compared to 41% in Germany.\n\nRisk exposure at the institutional level spills over into households: systems with equity-heavy public and occupational pensions see higher private equity participation in voluntary savings.\n\nMultiple reform strategies exist, but all share common features: scale, cost-efficient investment options, strong governance, professional asset management, broad coverage, portability, and well-designed financial incentives.\n\nThe ALFI/McGill study ‘Europe's productive capital gap’\n\nshows that Europe is falling behind in mobilising household and pension savings into productive investment compared to reformed pension economies such as Australia, Canada, and Sweden.\n\nThe study compares nine countries: four European economies with reformed, capital-based systems (Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and Sweden); two successful reformers outside Europe (Australia and Canada); and three major European economies still dominated by PAYG pensions (Germany, France, and Luxembourg).\n\nResearchers find that countries that transitioned to partly funded pension regimes in the 1990s are now poster-child cases of successful reform, showing how gradual changes, compound interest, and equity-heavy investment strategies can dramatically scale up national pools of risk capital.\n\nSerge Weyland, CEO at ALFI,\n\nsaid: “This study highlights how well-designed pension systems can mobilise retirement savings into productive risk capital. Europe has a unique opportunity to transform these savings into a powerful driver of growth. With the right governance, scale, and long-term vision, pension reforms can unlock the risk capital our economies need.”\n\nPatrick Augustin, Associate Professor in Finance at McGill University and Director of McGill Luxembourg Centre for Finance,\n\nhighlighted: “The most robust pension systems are not simply those that accumulate more savings, but those that allocate capital more efficiently—across public, occupational, and private pillars—through scale, governance, and long-term investment discipline.”\n\nLessons for Europe\n\nAs Europe faces similar political and demographic challenges as the countries examined, its reforms can draw on their experiences while tailoring solutions to local contexts. This study provides strong evidence and detailed insights that we hope will help shape the future agenda of Europe’s Savings and Investment Union.\n\nDownload\n\nthe photo of Serge Weyland (JPG)\n\nDownload\n\nthe photo of Patrick Augustin (JPG)\n\nDownload\n\nthe\n\nALFI/McGill ‘Europe's productive capital gap’ study (PDF format)\n\nDownload\n\nthe press release (PDF format).\n\n***\n\nNotes to editors:\n\nFor more information and interview requests, please contact:\n\nALFI, Luigi Salerno,\n\nHead of Communications:\n\nSalerno@alfi.lu\n\nPeregrine Communications:\n\nALFI@peregrinecommunications.com\n\nAbout ALFI\n\nThe Association of the Luxembourg Fund Industry (ALFI) represents the face and voice of the Luxembourg asset management and investment fund community.

        "content": "Luxembourg Real Estate Investment Funds Survey 2024\n\n16 July 2025\n\n|\n\nPress Releases\n\nLuxembourg, 16 July 2025\n\nLuxembourg REIFs evolve to meet a changing market\n\nThe latest edition of the ALFI REIF Survey highlights growth, flexibility and global reach of real estate funds. Indeed, the 2024 Survey confirmed the constant increase of the lightly regulated investment Funds.\n\nDuring a year affected by market stress, 80.75% of funds decided to hold onto their investments while only 1.4% opted to liquidate and reinvest — showing strong resilience.\n\nAn increased use of liquidity management tools (4.5% suspended redemptions, 16% processed redemptions in kind) highlights robust governance.\n\nIf most REIFs remain classified as Article 6 under SFDR, 24 funds upgraded to Article 8 or 9 — a positive signal for sustainability integration.\n\nLuxembourg continues to solidify its position as a leading hub for real estate investment funds (REIFs), according to the latest edition of the ALFI Real Estate Investment Funds Survey. The survey provides insights into how the market is adapting to shifting investor demands, regulatory evolution and broader macroeconomic trends.\n\nKey takeaways from the 2024 survey include:\n\nLighter structures gaining ground\n\nThe survey confirms a strong shift toward lightly regulated fund structures. RAIFs, manager-regulated AIFs and non-regulated vehicles now represent\n\n69.5%\n\nof the market, with the significant evolution from just one RAIF in 2016 to 226 in 2024. The SCS/SCSp legal form continues to dominate, used by 59% of surveyed funds, reflecting preferences for tax transparency and structural simplicity.\n\nInstitutional focus with broad strategies\n\nREIFs remain primarily institutional with an EU base of investors: 80.4% of investors come from Europe, and 83% of funds serve 25 or fewer investors. Multi-sector strategies are now the norm, followed by targeted allocations to residential, office and retail. This diversification reflects growing demand for flexibility and stability.\n\nResilience under pressure\n\nDespite market headwinds, Luxembourg REIFs showed notable resilience. Over 80% of funds chose to hold their investments during challenging conditions rather than liquidating or reinvesting. The use of liquidity management tools such as redemption gates remains limited, underscoring the long-term nature of the strategies employed. Only 4.5% of funds suspended redemptions, while 16% processed redemptions in kind, indicating that most managers rely on strong governance rather than reactive measures.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Christophe Masset, Partner at Deloitte, Cross-Border Tax stated: “The latest ALFI survey highlights the rising importance of liquidity management for Luxembourg real estate funds amid market stress driven by geopolitical shifts and monetary policy changes. Among funds using liquidity management tools, nearly 5% have suspended redemptions. As regulators finalize AIFMD and UCITS standards, Luxembourg remains at the forefront, providing a robust framework for managers to navigate these challenges”.\n\nThis cautious but steady approach reflects the long-term nature of REIF strategies and underlines investor confidence, even during volatile conditions.\n\nTrends in size, fees and leverage\n\nSmaller funds continue to make up the bulk of the market, but larger vehicles are gaining ground. Fee structures remain largely based on NAV, while performance fees are in decline. Use of leverage is becoming more conservative, aligned with a cautious view on debt in a higher-rate environment.\n\nThe survey confirms Luxembourg’s continued relevance as a jurisdiction of choice for global real estate strategies. The adoption of ELTIF 2.0 and growing openness to retail participation point to a sector that is not only evolving, but expanding.\n\n“ELTIF 2.0 tackles several challenges raised under ELTIF 1.0, through both enhanced product design and improved distribution,” said Britta Borneff, ALFI CMO.\n\nIn this context, the design of current and future product launches should carefully consider all key elements, including liquidity management programmes, distribution capacity, and the deployment of appropriate transfer agent technology, among others. Despite these complexities, the rapid growth of ELTIF 2.0 may well position it as a strong future counterpart to UCITS or AIFs.\"\n\nConcluding, she added\n\n“\n\nwith its flexibility, experience, and international reach, Luxembourg remains a reliable platform for real estate fund managers to innovate and grow .”\n\nDownload\n\nthe brochure.\n\nDownload\n\nthe press release in pdf.\n\nENDS\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nALFI\n\nLuigi Salerno\n\nALFI Head of Communications\n\nLuigi.salerno@alfi.lu\n\nPeregrine Communications\n\nALFI@peregrinecommunications.com\n\n***\n\nNotes to editors:\n\nAbout ALFI\n\nThe Association of the Luxembourg Fund Industry (ALFI) represents the face and voice of the Luxembourg asset management and investment fund community, championing mainstream, private assets and sustainable investing.
