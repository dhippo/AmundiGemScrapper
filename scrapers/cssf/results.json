        "content": "Communiqué de presse\n\nSituation globale des organismes de placement collectif à la fin du mois d’octobre 2025 (uniquement en anglais)\n\nCommuniqué de presse 25/19\n\nI. Overall situation\n\nAs at 31 October 2025, the total net assets of undertakings for collective investment, comprising UCIs subject to the 2010 Law, specialised investment funds and SICARs, amounted to EUR 6,162.301 billion compared to EUR 6,025.044 billion as at 30 September 2025, i.e. an increase of 2.28% over one month. Over the last twelve months, the volume of net assets increased by 8.77%.\n\nThe Luxembourg UCI industry thus registered a positive variation amounting to EUR 137.257 billion in October. This increase represents the sum of positive net capital investments of EUR 22.099 billion (0.37%) and of the positive development of financial markets amounting to EUR 115.158 billion (1.91%).\n\nThe development of undertakings for collective investment is as follows:\n\nThe number of undertakings for collective investment taken into consideration totalled 3,069, against 3,071 the previous month. A total of 2,050 entities adopted an umbrella structure representing 12,350 sub-funds. Adding the 1,019 entities with a traditional UCI structure to that figure, a total of 13,369 fund units were active in the financial centre.\n\nAs regards the impact of financial markets on the main categories of undertakings for collective investment and the net capital investment in these UCIs, the following can be said for the month of October.\n\nThe global economic environment was marked by renewed tensions between the US and China concerning notably rare earths, which are essential for artificial intelligence. However, a one-year trade truce was concluded between both countries late in the month resulting in a notable improvement in market sentiment. Against this backdrop, all equity UCIs categories posted substantial monthly gains, once again mostly fuelled by enthusiasm for AI and the broad benefits expected across the AI supply chain. Japanese equities recorded the strongest performance, further supported by the formation of a new government expected to implement expansionary policies favourable to markets. US equities delivered strong gains (with NVIDIA becoming the first company surpassing a market capitalisation of 5 trillion dollars), also helped by a 25-basis points rate cut by the Fed and solid corporate results. In contrast, European and Latin American equities, which are less exposed to AI, delivered comparatively lower performances, though still close to a solid 2%.\n\nIn October, equity UCI categories registered an overall positive capital investment from all categories except Global market equities, US equities and Asian equities which incurred outflows.\n\nDevelopment of equity UCIs during the month of October 2025*\n\nMarket variation in %\n\nNet issues in %\n\nGlobal market equities\n\n3.11%\n\n-0.17%\n\nEuropean equities\n\n1.93%\n\n1.18%\n\nUS equities\n\n3.72%\n\n-0.06%\n\nJapanese equities\n\n3.89%\n\n0.66%\n\nEastern European equities\n\n2.45%\n\n0.34%\n\nAsian equities\n\n2.65%\n\n-0.11%\n\nLatin American equities\n\n1.65%\n\n1.15%\n\nOther equities\n\n3.89%\n\n0.48%\n\n*\n\nVariation in % of Net Assets in EUR as compared to the previous month\n\nDuring the month, the Fed implemented a second consecutive 25-basis points rate cut despite divisions among voting members, amplified by incomplete economic data due to the prolonged US government shutdown. In Europe, the ECB maintained its policy stance, as widely expected. Bond markets benefitted from a fall in yields, both in the US and Europe, while credit spreads remained broadly stable, despite significant volatility during the month, notably due to concerns following the collapse of two large US companies. Favourable currency movements also supported performance, particularly the appreciation of the US dollar against the euro (reversing its downward trend of the previous months). Against this backdrop, all fixed income UCI categories delivered positive monthly returns.\n\nIn October, fixed income UCIs registered an overall positive net capital investment from all categories except USD money market, USD-denominated bonds and Global market bonds which incurred outflows.\n\nDevelopment of fixed income UCIs during the month of October 2025*\n\nMarket variation in %\n\nNet issues in %\n\nEUR money market\n\n0.14%\n\n1.41%\n\nUSD money market\n\n1.71%\n\n-0.73%\n\nGlobal money market\n\n0.02%\n\n1.91%\n\nEUR-denominated bonds\n\n0.71%\n\n2.25%\n\nUSD-denominated bonds\n\n1.34%\n\n-0.04%\n\nGlobal market bonds\n\n0.80%\n\n-0.21%\n\nEmerging market bonds\n\n1.83%\n\n0.72%\n\nHigh Yield bonds\n\n0.69%\n\n0.23%\n\nOthers\n\n1.06%\n\n1.80%\n\n*\n\nVariation in % of Net Assets in EUR as compared to the previous month\n\nThe development of net assets of diversified Luxembourg UCIs and funds of funds is illustrated in the table below:\n\nDevelopment of diversified UCIs and funds of funds during the month of October 2025*\n\nMarket variation in %\n\nNet issues in %\n\nDiversified UCIs\n\n2.01%\n\n0.59%\n\nFunds of funds\n\n1.77%\n\n0.17%\n\n*\n\nVariation in % of Net Assets in EUR as compared to the previous month\n\nII.

        "content": "Communiqué\n\nCompte à rebours avant la réduction de moitié des délais de règlement sur les marchés financiers – Enquête européenne à J+1 (uniquement en anglais)\n\nCSSF draws the attention of Luxembourg financial market participants to a European survey on T+1 and encourages them to share their views on the halving of settlement times for financial transactions across the EU.\n\nStarting from\n\n11 October 2027\n\n, European Regulation No. 2025/2075 of 14 October 2025, amending Regulation (EU) 909/2014) introduces the migration from the\n\nT+2\n\nsettlement cycle to\n\nT+1\n\n.\n\nThis means that for the exchange of cash and securities for transactions in transferable securities which are executed on trading venues, the settlement date shall be no later than on the first business day after the trading takes place. This is a significant change that requires a review of operational processes across the entire post-trading chain.\n\nTo support the market throughout this transformation, the EU Industry Committee — the forum bringing together representatives of key stakeholders, including the European Commission, the ECB and ESMA — has launched a survey across the 27 EU Member States to monitor market participants’ level of preparedness.\n\nBroad and active participation is crucial, because it enables us to:\n\nGauge the entire industry’s readiness\n\nfor the shift to T+1 — from large market infrastructures to smaller intermediaries — and identify which segments may require additional preparation or support.\n\nSurface operational bottlenecks and structural frictions\n\n— for instance: potential liquidity pressures, infrastructure- or process-related constraints (e.g. matching, settlement instructions, corporate-event processing) — so that these can be addressed well ahead of the go-live date.\n\nPromote harmonisation and standardisation across jurisdictions, infrastructures and market participants\n\n— a key objective of the EU transition, to ensure that T+1 becomes a consistent, efficient, and interoperable settlement standard across the Union’s fragmented capital markets.\n\nSupport a well-orchestrated, resilient and efficient transition\n\n— enabling stakeholders to coordinate timing, system upgrades, testing, and regulatory compliance; reducing the risk of settlement fails or operational disruption; and safeguarding overall market stability and integrity.\n\nThe results will be shared, in aggregated and anonymised form, with ESMA, the ECB and the relevant national competent authorities, including the CSSF.\n\nThe survey is open until\n\n19 December 2025\n\nSurvey:\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/epRvaVk2\n\nMore information on the T+1 project and the work of the Industry Committee:\n\nhttps://eu-t1.eu/\n\nFinally, the CSSF reminds that active engagement from senior leadership of Luxembourg market participants is essential to:\n\nAssess the organisation’s strategic readiness for T+1\n\n, ensuring that governance, technology, liquidity management, and operational capabilities are aligned with a faster settlement environment and with evolving client expectations.\n\nIdentify business-critical risks and dependencies\n\nacross the value chain — including cross-border settlement, collateral and cash management, operational scalability, and third-party/vendor resilience — so that executive teams can prioritise investment and mitigate disruption well ahead of the transition.\n\nStrengthen industry-wide coordination\n\n, ensuring that banks, asset managers, market infrastructures and service providers move in sync. High-level alignment reduces fragmentation, enhances settlement efficiency, and limits the risk of systemic bottlenecks during the migration.\n\nPosition the organisation in market transformation driven by T+1\n\n, contributing to a structured, predictable and safe transition for clients and the broader financial ecosystem — and demonstrating proactive stewardship towards regulatory change and market integrity.\n\nMots clés\n\nAdministration centrale\n\nCabinet d'audit\n\nCabinet de révision agréé\n\nCalcul de VNI\n\nContrepartie centrale (CCP)\n\nCSDR (RDCT)\n\nDépositaire\n\nGestion des risques\n\nOpérations de financement sur titres (SFTs)\n\nSettlement Internaliser (Internalisateur de règlement)\n\nThème principal:\n\nRèglement T+1\n\nPertinent pour\n\nDépositaires Centraux de Titres (DCT)\n\nEntreprises d'investissement\n\nÉtablissements de crédit\n\nGestionnaires de fonds d'investissement\n\nOrganismes de placement collectif en valeurs mobilières (OPCVM)\n\nOrganismes de Placement Collectif soumis à la Partie II de la loi du 17 décembre 2010 (OPC Partie II)\n\nSociétés d’investissement en capital à risque (SICAR)\n\nSupervision publique de la profession de l'audit"

Les réponses devront être soumises au plus tard le\n\n3 avril 2026\n\nà travers la plateforme eDesk de la CSSF.\n\nThe CSSF will launch its annual online questionnaire for the year 2025 on\n\n23 February 2026\n\n.\n\nThe objective is to collect standardised key information concerning\n\nmoney laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF)\n\nrisks to which professionals under CSSF supervision are exposed, and the implementation of measures to mitigate these risks. This cross-sector questionnaire contributes to the CSSF’s ongoing assessment of ML/TF risks present in the financial sector under its supervision and forms part of the AML/CFT risk-based supervision approach put in place by the CSSF.\n\nThe 2025 questionnaire is subject to some changes compared to the previous year. The new and amended questions have been indicated in the questionnaire.\n\nThe final submission of the questionnaire will have to be completed through the\n\nCSSF eDesk platform\n\nby 3 April 2026 (at the latest)\n\n.\n\nAs in previous years, the Application Programming Interface (“API”) solution is still applicable. The API user guide is again available under the following\n\nlink\n\n:\n\nMethods of transmitting reports via API – CSSF\n\n.\n\nThe questionnaire must be completed within the CSSF eDesk platform by:\n\nthe\n\ncompliance officer\n\nin charge of the control of compliance with the professional obligation\n\ns\n\n1\n\n(“\n\nresponsable du contrôle du respect des obligations professionnelles\n\n” (“\n\nRC\n\n”)), or\n\nthe\n\nperson responsible for compliance with the professional obligations\n\n2\n\n(“\n\nresponsable du respect des obligations professionnelles\n\n” (“\n\nRR\n\n”)).\n\nThe completion of the questionnaire, however, may be assigned within the CSSF eDesk platform to another employee of the entity or third party, while bearing in mind that the\n\nultimate responsibility\n\nfor the adequate completion of the questionnaire shall remain with the “RC” or the “RR”. This implies that the aforementioned person and his/her potential delegate hold an eDesk account, which requires a LuxTrust authentication.\n\nIn order to avoid connection problems when the questionnaire will be launched, the CSSF invites all entities it supervises for AML/CFT purposes to ensure they have an account. Reference is made to the “eDesk – Authentication – User Guide” on the CSSF\n\neDesk Portal homepage\n\nfor further details.\n\nMoreover, the CSSF would like to make obliged entities aware that an additional, ad hoc questionnaire will be launched in the first half of the year 2026 in parallel to the Questionnaire on Financial Crime. This ad hoc questionnaire, addressed to credit and financial institutions, will collect data to prepare the selection of the financial sector entities that will be directly supervised by the new\n\nEuropean Anti-Money Laundering Authority (“AMLA”)\n\nstarting on 1 January 2028. Specifically, data may be requested on the\n\nfree provision of services\n\n.\n\nThis data will be communicated to AMLA and used amongst others for the preliminary selection of eligible entities for direct supervision.\n\nAMLA is expected to select, during 2027, 40 obliged entities to be directly supervised\n\n3\n\n.

        "content": "Communiqué de presse\n\nAttaque de la chaîne d’approvisionnement employant les paquets NPM (uniquement en anglais)\n\nCommuniqué de presse 25/18\n\nA sophisticated “worm”, called “Shai-Hulud 2.0” is spreading through the software development world, infecting trusted coding tools (“NPM packages”) used by millions of developers. Unlike typical cyberattacks targeting one company, this attack hijacks the software supply chain itself, poisoning the “building blocks” that developers worldwide use to create apps, websites, and business systems.\n\nWhy this\n\nexceptionally dangerous\n\n: this malware operates like a contagion. When a developer installs an infected tool (even from a trusted source), the malware immediately looks for credentials and digital keys. It then uses those stolen credentials and digital keys to infect other software packages that a victim developer maintains, spreading to anyone who trusts them. Furthermore, the initial infection is hard to detect, because it infects computers via pre-install scripts the moment the installation process begins, often before security tools can intervene.\n\nThis creates an exponential infection chain across the entire software ecosystem.\n\nThe malware then automatically\n\npublishes stolen credentials and digital keys on public websites\n\n. More alarmingly,\n\nthe malware installs permanent backdoors\n\nthat let attackers remotely control infected computers (via deployment of “self-hosted runners”), even after the malware is removed. These backdoors blend into normal work traffic (through GitHub),\n\nmaking them hardly detectable\n\n.\n\nThe installed backdoors pose ongoing risk for future exploitation\n\nof corporate systems and cloud infrastructure.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that the attack is spreading to other technology of packages, meaning that this supply chain attack may continue using different forms.\n\nArticles from security researchers are easily accessible online to help the supervised entities in their threat hunting practice.\n\nCIRCL, the Computer Incident Center Luxembourg\n\n, published a report on this subject, including recommendations, available at this URL:\n\nhttps://www.circl.lu/pub/tr-97\n\n.\n\nThe CSSF strongly recommends all supervised entities concerned to take duly note of this report and to take actions as appropriate.\n\nMots clés\n\nCybersécurité\n\nTechnologies de l'Information et de la Communication (TIC)\n\nPertinent pour\n\nDépositaires Centraux de Titres (DCT)\n\nÉmetteurs de jetons\n\nEntreprises d'investissement\n\nÉtablissements de crédit\n\nÉtablissements de paiement/Établissements de monnaie électronique/Prestataires de services d’information sur les comptes\n\nFonds et véhicules d'investissement\n\nGestionnaires de crédits\n\nGestionnaires de fonds d'investissement\n\nIntermédiaires de crédit immobilier\n\nPrestataires de communication de données (PSCD)\n\nPrestataires de services de financement participatif\n\nPrestataires de Services d’Actifs Virtuels (PSAV)\n\nPrestataires de services sur crypto-actifs (PSCA)\n\nPSF de support\n\nPSF spécialisés\n\nSupervision publique de la profession de l'audit"
