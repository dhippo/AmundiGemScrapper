They are doing this for the first time in line with new sustainability reporting rules, where the information must be relevant, reliable, understandable, and comparable. The AFM conducted an exploratory review among several major Dutch banks and insurers. In the report ‘Towards transparent reporting on climate transition plans and financed emissions’, we present a market overview and provide key considerations for a more standardised approach to transition plans in sustainability reports.\n\nIn short\n\n•\tTransition plans in sustainability reports provide insight into strategic choices for climate transition\n\n•\tSustainability reporting is a learning process\n\n•\tMarket overview: banks\n\n•\tMarket overview: insurers\n\n•\tData quality in the value chain remains challenge\n\nTransition plans in sustainability reports provide insight into strategic choices for climate transition\n\nIn 2024, the institutions under review published a sustainability report for the first time in line with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). They did so voluntarily, as this directive has not yet been implemented in Dutch law. A key component of sustainability reporting is the transition plan, which all eight institutions included in their reports.\n\nSustainability reporting is a learning process\n\nReporting under the CSRD is a learning process—for the institutions themselves, but also for other stakeholders, including the AFM. We therefore encourage the sector to continue working towards a more standardised approach and in our report provide key considerations going forward for the entire sector. This will enable users of the reports to assess and compare the impact, risks, and opportunities of institutions regarding climate and transition plans. The sector is already involved in several (national and international) initiatives and collaborations aimed at improving and developing sustainability reporting and transition plans. The AFM encourages the sector to continue these industry initiatives for further standardisation.\n\nMarket overview: banks\n\nOur review shows that the banks reviewed provide detailed and extensive reporting on their emissions and plans. All four banks report on their transition plan and interim targets. However, the scope and depth still vary significantly. For banks, financed emissions from corporate loans are particularly relevant, as these represent by far the largest source of emissions. Banks provide insight into the sectors they finance and the targets and plans per sector. Consistency in definitions, measurement methods, and metrics within and across annual reports, could be improved to further clarify the scope of the plans and enhance comparability.\n\nMarket overview: insurers\n\nThe four insurers reviewed report on their emissions data per asset class in broadly comparable ways, but the level of detail differs. Most financed emissions relate to corporate bonds and sovereign bonds. The transition plans mainly focus on financed emissions from own investments. Comparability among insurers is still limited due to differences in scope, metrics, and reporting formats. Additional information on decarbonisation is often provided outside the annual report.\n\nData quality in the value chain remains challenge\n\nAll institutions reviewed indicate that data quality in the value chain remains a major challenge. Uncertainties arise from limited data availability, particularly further down the value chain. Obtaining reliable and up-to-date data from parties deeper in the value chain is more complex than from direct counterparties. As a result, institutions rely heavily on estimates, models, and external data providers.\n\nTags\n\nSustainability"

These models are used to assist in portfolio choices and risk management, but they may also introduce new vulnerabilities. Errors in development or use can lead to incorrect decisions and damage. The report ‘\n\nModel risk management by asset managers\n\n’ shows how the sector is currently dealing with these challenges and what steps asset managers can take to better manage model risk.\n\nIn Short\n\n•\n\nMore models, more risk –\n\nComplex models and AI increase the likelihood of errors and financial damage.\n\n•\n\nPractical tools\n\n–\n\nEight good practices help asset managers get a grip on model risk.\n\n•\n\nClear agreements and dialogue are essential\n\n–\n\nThere is no uniform approach; knowledge sharing and dialogue are necessary.\n\nThe study is based on a broad survey of 250 market participants and an in-depth questionnaire completed by 14 asset managers. The aim is to provide insight into current practice and encourage efforts to strengthen model risk management.\n\nMore models, more risk\n\nDue to AI and smart data analysis, asset managers are using increasingly complex models. This helps them make decisions, but it also entails risks. If there are errors in the development or use of a model, this can lead to incorrect choices and damage. That is why the Financial Supervision Act (Wft) stipulates that asset managers must maintain control and integrity in their business operations – including the proper management of model risk.\n\nPractical tools\n\nHow do you tackle model risk? This report contains eight concrete tips. Start with a clear structure for who is responsible for models. Ensure that everyone shares a common understanding of the term ‘model’ and determine how much risk you are willing to take. Maintain an overview with a central list of all models and always validate them before use and regularly afterwards. Work with a life cycle: from development to termination. Also draw up rules for models from external parties and ensure that you have sufficient internal knowledge to recognise and manage risks. These guidelines are not mandatory, but they help to keep control of a complex and rapidly changing area.\n\nClear agreements and dialogue are essential\n\nOur research shows that asset managers recognise the importance of model risk management, but that definitions and approaches vary greatly. Governance is often not explicitly defined and risk appetite is rarely formally stated. Yet this would strengthen controlled and ethical business operations. That is precisely why it is important to continue the dialogue on this subject – with regulators and with parties that supply models, such as external models and AI applications. By sharing knowledge and experiences, the sector can work towards a common understanding and a more consistent approach. The AFM will continue to monitor this topic and invites the sector to work together to strengthen model risk management.\n\nTags\n\nInformatie voor pensioenuitvoerders\n\nInformation for AIFM and collective investment schemes\n\nInvestment firms\n\nSector\n\nTrading and settlement platforms"

Although shocks have been well absorbed so far, this resilience cannot be taken for granted. Capital markets are becoming increasingly intertwined, which increases systemic risks, while beliefs are shifting. This calls for a different approach. In its report Thinking in scenarios in capital markets, the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) calls on market participants, policymakers and regulators to actively embrace scenario thinking.\n\nIn short\n\nInterconnectedness increases systemic risks\n\nScenarios reveal vulnerabilities\n\nWorking together for robust capital markets\n\nInterconnectedness increases systemic risks\n\nCapital markets are complex and highly intertwined. Stress is not caused by a single error, but by collective behavior and dependencies. Incidents such as the COVID-19 shock and the LME nickel incident show how quickly robust systems can collapse.\n\nScenarios reveal vulnerabilities\n\nThe traditional approach with static structures remains valuable but falls short in an unpredictable world. Risk management requires imagination: scenario thinking is not about predicting the future, but about imagining impactful futures. This reveals hidden risks. Using an example scenario - in which loss of confidence in the dollar, cyber-attacks and risks associated with stablecoins converge - the AFM shows how vulnerabilities can accumulate and put pressure on European market infrastructure.\n\nWorking together for robust capital markets\n\nThe AFM calls for action: market participants, regulators and policymakers must embed scenario thinking in supervision, strategy and risk management. We are engaging in dialogue with the sector about the scenarios we need to prepare for and are advocating for European supervision that takes a system-wide view. Only by working together can we identify risks at an early stage, limit crises and strengthen confidence in European capital markets in a sustainable manner.\n\nTags\n\nInformation for AIFM and collective investment schemes\n\nInvestment firms\n\nProvider of investment objects"

Also in the financial sector, there is growing interest in so-called ‘hyperpersonalisation’: tailoring online choice environments based on characteristics, preferences, and behaviour of consumers. Financial firms currently make limited use of hyperpersonalisation, according to an analysis by the AFM. Hyperpersonalisation offers opportunities but also requires careful and responsible application. Together with the sector, the AFM wants to explore how these opportunities can be used in the interest of consumers.\n\nIn short\n\nPossibilities for personalising online choice environments are substantial\n\nFinancial sector is paying attention to (hyper)personalisation; current application is still limited\n\nMore targeted and effective influence on consumers presents both opportunities and risks\n\nPersonalisation calls for careful and responsible application\n\nPossibilities for personalising online choice environments are substantial\n\nThe combination of large volumes of individual data and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) enables companies to refine customer profiles and personalise online choice environments with increasing precision. Content, tone, order and design can be tailored to consumer characteristics, preferences and behaviour. In its most advanced form, this is referred to as hyperpersonalisation. Examples include the Netflix interface that is tailored to users’ viewing preferences, the TikTok feed that shows exactly what holds someone’s attention, Booking.com that offers travel recommendations based on previous choices, or a webshop suggesting products purchased by similar consumers.\n\nFinancial sector is paying attention to (hyper)personalisation; current application is still limited\n\nCompared to other sectors, (hyper)personalisation of the choice environment in the financial sector is still limited. For example, it does not go beyond minder adjustments to information based on factors such as age or whether someone has a mortgage or not. The first steps towards more advanced forms of personalisation are mainly focused on online advertising and in-app banners. Firms are amongst others held back by practical barriers and legal uncertainties. According to our exploration, financial firms intend to (further) personalise choice environments in the future. They expect conversational AI to play an increasingly important role. This technology is developing rapidly, which could mean that today’s customer service chatbot could evolve into a fully-fledged financial assistant.\n\nMore targeted and effective influence on consumers presents both opportunities and risks\n\nBy personalising the choice environment, firms can influence users’ attention and behaviour in a more targeted and effective manner. This offers both opportunities and risks. Personalisation can be used to benefit consumers, for example by personalised warnings or reminders, or offering greater insight into one’s personal financial situation. However, personalisation may also amplify the existing risk of adverse influence of the choice environment.\n\nPersonalisation calls for careful and responsible application\n\nTogether with financial firms, the AFM wants to explore how personalisation of the choice environment can be used to promote sensible financial decision making. It is important that firms handle these new possibilities in a careful and responsible manner. This means that firms should refrain from using personalisation when this does not serve the customer’s interests. It is also important that supervision responds in a timely manner to developments related to the personalisation of choice environments. The AFM will further explore this topic and the barriers that firms face; and will act where needed and involve the sector. Additionally, we will examine how to maintain adequate oversight and supervision of increasingly personalised online choice environments and their impact on consumers.\n\nTags\n\nAdviseurs, bemiddelaars & gevolmachtigde agenten\n\nBanken & verzekeraars\n\nInvestment firms\n\nKredietaanbieders"

Ongoing geopolitical tensions, interdependencies and the increasing interconnectedness of the traditional financial system with cryptos and other more lightly regulated markets make the sector vulnerable. The Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) emphasizes that the risks remain large, complex and opaque in the\n\nTrend Monitor 2026\n\nreport, which is published today. In addition, the AFM conducted an analysis of two topics: scenario thinking and hyper-personalisation.\n\nIn short\n\nOngoing geopolitical tensions call for vigilance and resilience\n\nEuropean cooperation more important than ever\n\nAnalysis: Hyper-personalisation with AI offers opportunities for financial services\n\nOngoing geopolitical tensions call for vigilance and resilience\n\nThe financial markets are deeply interconnected internationally and dependent on a limited number of dominant market participants, many of which are non-European, such as for IT services. The traditional financial system is also becoming increasingly intertwined with crypto and private markets. Combined with geopolitical tensions and uncertain trade policies, this makes them vulnerable and susceptible to shocks. Although markets have absorbed the shocks well so far, the sustainability of this resilience is not self-evident..\n\nLaura van Geest, Chair of the AFM Executive Board: 'The positive mood in the financial markets is treacherous, because it is based on only a fragile balance. That is why we must be vigilant and resilient, and embrace thinking in scenarios – not to predict, but to be prepared.'\n\nRead ‘Thinking in scenarios in capital markets’\n\nEuropean cooperation more important than ever\n\nRisks spread quickly across borders, for example through digital platforms or international capital flows. This requires joint European action. To ensure stability and innovation, European capital markets need to be deepened and broadened. For this, it is essential that the Savings & Investment Union actually becomes a reality.\n\nAnalysis: Hyper-personalisation with AI offers opportunities for financial services\n\nDue to the growth of data sources and AI applications, services are becoming increasingly personal. Apps and websites can be tailored to individual consumers. In its most advanced form, this is called hyper-personalisation. This is already common in sectors such as e-commerce and entertainment, but is still in its infancy in the financial sector.\n\nFinancial companies want to focus more on personalisation, but are reluctant to do so due to practical barriers and legal uncertainties. The AFM wants to explore, together with the sector, how the possibilities of personalisation can be used in the customer’s best interest.\n\nRead ‘Hyperpersonalisation: a tailored online choice environment’"
