        "content": "ESMA welcomes Commission’s ambitious proposal on market integration\n\nThe European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU’s financial markets regulator and supervisor, welcomes the\n\nEuropean Commission’s legislative proposal on market integration and supervision\n\npublished today. The package represents a major step towards deeper and more efficient EU capital markets and reflects many of the recommendations set out in ESMA’s 2024 Position Paper on building more effective and attractive capital markets in the EU.\n\nThe proposal directly addresses fragmentation stemming from divergent national rules and supervisory practices. By removing barriers in trading, post-trading and asset management, and by enabling more harmonised supervision, the package will help market participants operate more seamlessly across the Single Market and support scale, efficiency and better outcomes for investors and businesses. We also welcome the strong focus on streamlining regulatory requirements, reducing administrative burden, and facilitating innovation.\n\nAll of this will enhance the competitiveness and agility of EU capital markets.\n\nA key element of the package is the proposed transfer of direct supervision of certain significant cross-border infrastructures and crypto-asset service providers to the EU level. ESMA stands ready to take on these specific responsibilities, drawing on almost 15 years of growing experience supervising diverse and selective parts of our capital markets.\n\nThis proposal represents a shift in supervision for a limited subset of our capital markets, in which ESMA would work hand in hand with the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to develop the capacity and expertise to take on such new responsibilities. At the same time, for the broader market that remains under national supervision, coordinating supervisory standards and achieving aligned outcomes across the EU remains a key priority. This would be reinforced for example by giving ESMA an enhanced convergence role for large cross-border asset management groups.\n\nToday’s proposal forms a central pillar of the Commission’s Savings and Investments Union (SIU) strategy. ESMA looks forward to working with the co-legislators as they advance this important initiative to build deeper and more integrated EU capital markets.\n\nFurther information:\n\nSolveig Kleiveland\n\nTeam Leader - Communications\n\npress@esma.europa.eu"

This designation marks a crucial step in the implementation of the\n\nDORA oversight\n\nframework.\n\nThe list of the CTPP designated by the ESAs is accessible through this\n\nlink\n\n.\n\nThe designation process followed the methodology mandated by DORA.\n\nFirst, the ESAs collected data from the Registers of Information maintained by financial entities, which detail their contractual arrangements for ICT services.\n\nSecond, the ESAs conducted a detailed criticality assessment in cooperation with the Competent Authorities (CAs) across the EU from the banking, insurance and pensions, and securities and markets sectors. This assessment was carried out in line with the multifaceted criteria set out in DORA, which required a complete evaluation of a provider’s systemic importance, its role in supporting critical or important functions for financial entities, and the level of substitutability of its services.\n\nThird, ICT third-party providers assessed as critical were formally notified, after which they benefitted from their right to be heard by providing a reasoned statement. The final designation decisions were adopted following a careful review of all relevant information, ensuring the integrity of the process.\n\nThe designated CTPPs provide a range of ICT services (e.g. from core infrastructure to business and data services) to financial entities of all types and sizes across the European Union, reflecting their pivotal role within the financial ecosystem.\n\nThe objective of the DORA Oversight Framework, mandated to the ESAs, is to promote the sound management of ICT risk by the critical providers. Through direct oversight engagement, the ESAs will assess whether CTPPs have appropriate risk management and governance frameworks in place to ensure the resilience of the services they deliver to financial entities. This serves to mitigate risks that could impact the operational resilience of the financial sector of the EU.\n\nThe ESAs will keep engaging with CTPPs in the course of upcoming examination activities.\n\nFurther information:\n\nCristina Bonillo\n\nSenior Communications Officer\n\npress@esma.europa.eu"
