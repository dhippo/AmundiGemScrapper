        "content": "Central Bank of Ireland launches Access to Cash consultation\n05 December 2025\nPress Release\nThe Central Bank of Ireland has today (5 December) launched a public consultation on the implementation of our new Access to Cash responsibilities.\nDeputy Governor Vasileios Madouros said: “Amid a rapidly evolving payments landscape, the Central Bank of Ireland is committed to making sure that cash continues to be readily available as a means of payment. Today’s consultation is an important step towards the implementation of the Central Bank’s new responsibilities under the Access to Cash legislation.”\nThe public consultation covers two parts of the new Access to Cash regime.\nFirstly, the new legislation provides for the identification of local deficiencies in the cash infrastructure. That relates to certain geographical areas where there may be particular difficulties in accessing cash, even if the Access to Cash criteria are being met. The Central Bank is required to prepare guidelines setting out how we will receive notifications, undertake assessments, and make determinations regarding local deficiencies in cash infrastructure. Today’s public consultation is seeking views on our proposed guidelines.\nSecondly, we are consulting on setting minimum ATM service standards and notifications requirements for firms operating ATMs. In 2026, we will publish regulations outlining ATM service standards relating to the hours of ATM availability, cash withdrawal limits, banknote denomination stocking, maximum ATM unavailability periods, and signage and information requirements.  The regulations will also set out requirements for ATM operators to notify the Central Bank and the public when they intend to make changes to their business.\nDeputy Governor Vasileios Madouros said: “This is an opportunity for members of the public and key stakeholders to have a say in how these important elements of the legislation will be implemented. We want to hear a wide range of views, so that we can implement these provisions in an effective, balanced and proportionate manner.”\nThe period of open public consultation will run from 5 December 2025 until\n4 March 2026. We welcome feedback on one or both parts of the consultation, and feedback can be provided in a single response, if preferred.\nThe Central Bank of Ireland will also engage directly with consumers, people with disabilities, older people and SMEs, in particular in the retail and hospitality sectors, during the first three months of 2026.\nENDS\nFurther Information\nAdditional information and the consultations are available on the\nCentral Bank of Ireland website\n."

Retail investors in Ireland are more likely to have a higher level of educational attainment, be in employment, have higher income levels, be male, be aged between 35 and 54 and live in the greater Dublin area.\nThe report finds that the decision to invest is driven by a complex interplay of factors and that individuals are motivated to start investing by practical and aspirational financial goals. Key barriers to investment identified in the report include a perceived lack of financial resources, psychological barriers such as fear and lack of trust, lack of knowledge and understanding about investment and lack of support and advice.\nThe report also points to measures to tackle these barriers and improve retail investment. These include product options and financial education measures.\nSome 10% of people report owning crypto-assets, predominately young males. The amounts tend to be small (€2,266 average) and mostly for reasons other than providing for their financial future (e.g. 56% cite curiosity as their reason).\nDeputy Governor Colm Kincaid said: “A properly functioning financial market must reflect and serve the needs and preferences of all consumers and investors. This research provides a comprehensive society-wide insight into those needs and preferences which can inform public policy at an important juncture, as we look to improve access to capital markets for retail investors.\nIn particular the research shows that, as things stand, financial services is not effective in reaching the full population of potential investors. This means Irish households may not be getting the full benefit of what financial services could do to help them provide for their future.”\nENDS"

        "content": "Effective and efficient regulation and supervision are among the most important contributors we can make to stability, resilience and confidence in the financial system – Central Bank of Ireland hosts fourth annual Financial System Conference\n25 November 2025\nPress Release\nThe Central Bank of Ireland today (25 November) hosts its fourth annual Financial System Conference. The conference brings together domestic and international industry leaders, consumer representatives and policymakers to discuss key issues impacting the financial system.\nSpeaking at the conference, Governor Gabriel Makhlouf said the work of central banks and regulators matters now more than ever in a changing, fragmented world, to deliver monetary and financial stability and ensure the financial system continues to operate in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy.\nHe said: “Effective and efficient regulation and supervision are among the most important contributors we can make to stability, resilience and confidence in the financial system. The experience of the past years has reinforced my view that a strong regulatory system does not depend on the number of rules, but on the quality of those rules, the fairness of their application, and the confidence they inspire.\n“This year, the world of financial regulation has been buzzing with phrases such as deregulation, de-supervision, modernisation and simplification. My preference is continuing to focus on being forward-looking, connected, proportionate, predictable, transparent and agile, or, to put it another way, regulating and supervising well.\n“Regulating well is not about loosening standards or dismantling the architecture that protects consumers and ensures financial stability. It is about making sure that what we do is clear, consistent and coherent, so that rules are understood, applied predictably, and achieve their purpose without unnecessary burden or complexity.”\nOn the next phase of the Central Bank’s evolution, Governor Makhlouf said, “Over recent years, we have streamlined and strengthened our supervision, authorisation and engagement processes. We have introduced a new supervisory approach which remains risk-based and outcomes focused but is more integrated across the Bank.\n“We have improved our external-facing processes including authorisations, making them more transparent, consistent and predictable. The outcomes we have achieved in our first Innovation Sandbox programme also represent a new model for innovation engagement, where collaboration with industry accelerates safe innovation.\n“The way we make policy has evolved. The mortgage measures are a good example of regulation that learns in practice and shows how we evaluate and refine frameworks over time, drawing on data, evidence and experience to maintain both resilience and access to sustainable lending.\nGovernor Makhlouf acknowledged the work the Central Bank is doing at a European level, noting that high quality regulation depends on coherence between domestic and European frameworks. He said, “We are reviewing frameworks to ensure alignment with evolving EU law, coherence across domestic regimes, and proportionality in application.  We expect, for instance, that our existing anti-money laundering framework will mostly be replaced by new EU Regulations.\n“As we have brought in new regulations domestically, we are also reviewing our existing ones. For example, we are going to review the corporate governance requirements in 2026 to remove duplication, improve alignment across sectors, and embed proportionality and clarity into governance design.”\nGovernor Makhlouf said, “What matters to me most is the discipline behind these projects: to review what we have built, to align with best practice while meeting domestic needs, and to ensure that rules continue to serve their purpose, while we remain focused on doing our job.”\nGovernor Makhlouf made it clear that there should be no confusion of efforts to make better policy and improve processes with a weakening of the Bank’s approach to regulation and supervision. “The standards we expect of regulated firms won’t be lowered. We will not dial back our supervision. We will continue to take enforcement action where necessary. And if changes to the risk landscape mean we have to introduce new rules or requirements, we will do so.”\nOver the coming weeks, the Central Bank will publish a list of ongoing initiatives to make the domestic regulatory framework more straightforward, including consulting on a new Regulatory Impact Assessment Framework next year. The Central Bank will also continue to actively engage with others on how to streamline the European rulebook to strengthen the Single Market.\nGovernor Makhlouf said, “A commitment to regulating well and being more straightforward does not mean a commitment to no new regulation; rather it means ensuring that each new measure is well-designed, well-justified, and well-understood. Regulating well and supervising well ultimately means ensuring clarity of purpose, coherence of process and consistency of principle.\n“Robust, efficient and effective regulation and supervision is not a luxury; it is a necessity and one of the most important ways we can contribute to resilience at home and confidence abroad. If we continue to challenge ourselves, be humble about the value of learning continuously, and evolve our frameworks in a disciplined way, then I am confident that the financial system will continue to work well, whatever the external environment throws at us.”\nENDS\nFurther information:\nkelly.horn@centralbank.ie\nmedia@centralbank.ie\nRead the Governor’s full opening remarks"

        "content": "Central Bank of Ireland welcomes announcement of access to cash regulations\n24 November 2025\nPress Release\nCentral Bank of Ireland welcomes today’s announcement by the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance that regulations relating to the Finance (Provision of Access to Cash Infrastructure) Act will come into effect this week.\nAs required by the Act, the Minister for Finance prescribes the percentage of the population that must be within a specified distance of an ATM and a cash service point and sets the minimum number of ATMs per 100,000 people in each NUTS\n1\nregion. Under the Act, certain credit institutions – referred to as designated entities – will be responsible for maintaining access to cash at minimum levels. The Minister prescribes the percentage shares of current accounts and household deposits that a credit institution may have that will determine whether they are a designated entity. The Minister consulted with the Central Bank prior to prescribing the criteria.\nGovernor Gabriel Makhlouf said: “Amid a rapidly changing payments landscape, the Central Bank is committed to ensuring cash is readily available as a means of payment. The regulations announced today are an important step towards ensuring that consumers continue to have access to cash and in protecting the resilience of the cash system. They will also provide for the fair, orderly and transparent management of Ireland’s cash infrastructure as payment preferences continue to evolve.”\nThe Act provides for new responsibilities for the Central Bank, including monitoring compliance with the access to cash criteria set in these regulations as well as oversight of operators of ATMs and cash-in-transit providers.\nThe Central Bank will continue to work with key cash cycle stakeholders as the focus shifts towards implementation of the new legislation.  Key elements of this work include:\nAccess to cash monitoring and publication\n- the Central Bank will gather data on a quarterly basis in relation to the number, location and hours of availability of ATMs and cash service points. The data will also be used to publish information on a quarterly basis on the Central Bank website. The first publication of this cash infrastructure data is expected early next year\n.\nThe Central Bank will monitor this data to assess compliance with the Act and assess proposals by designated entities to remedy non-compliance.\nService standards\n– the Central Bank will commence consultation before the end of the year on proposed regulations for minimum ATM service standards.\nThis will outline proposed requirements for ATM operators including the hours of ATM availability, cash withdrawal limits and banknote denominations available from ATMs. Service standards will apply following completion of this consultation process and the subsequent making of the relevant regulations by the Central Bank.\nLocal deficiencies\n– the Act provides for the identification and remedying of local deficiencies – i.e. where particular difficulties in accessing cash may arise in certain areas. The Central Bank will commence consultation before the end of the year on proposed guidelines outlining how individuals and businesses can notify the Central Bank about a potential local deficiency. The Central Bank will publish local deficiency guidelines by 30 June 2026, following which the Central Bank will be responsible for reviewing notifications from the public where they believe there is insufficient access to cash services in an area. Following analysis and assessment, the Central Bank will, where appropriate, notify the designated entities of a local deficiency and require that they take steps to address the local deficiency.\nFurther information on\nAccess to Cash can be found on the Central Bank of Ireland website\n.\nFurther Information\n[1] In Ireland, the definition of NUTS 3 refers to eight statistical regions. The \"\nNomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics\n\" (NUTS) is a system of the European Union for defining territorial units for the production of regional statistics, with NUTS 3 being the smallest subdivision level used for specific diagnostic purposes within the EU."
